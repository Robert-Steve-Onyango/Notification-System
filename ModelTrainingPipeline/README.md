# Model Training Pipeline Automation

This project showcases an automated training pipeline for object detection models, enabling model retraining and performance monitoring.

## Features
- Automated Training: Set up an end-to-end training pipeline for object detection models.
- Model Versioning: Implement model versioning and deployment best practices.
- Performance Monitoring: Monitor and log model performance metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- MLflow (for tracking experiments)
- Docker (for containerization)
- AWS (for cloud deployment)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Configure training data and model settings.
4. Run the training pipeline.
