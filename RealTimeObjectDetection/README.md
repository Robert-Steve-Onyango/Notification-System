# Real-Time Object Detection and Scoring Application

This project demonstrates a Python application that processes images from camera APIs or RTSP streams and runs multiple AI models (PyTorch and TensorFlow) for object detection and scoring.

## Features
- AI Model Integration: Utilize PyTorch and TensorFlow for object detection.
- Real-Time Scoring: Implement image scoring modules for real-time applications.
- Notification Module: Send email/push notifications based on model results or anomalies.
- Performance Optimization: Enhance model inference speed and accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Flask (for API integration)
- Docker (for containerization)
- AWS (for cloud deployment)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies.
3. Configure camera API/RTSP stream settings.
4. Run the application.
